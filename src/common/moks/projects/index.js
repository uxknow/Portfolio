      This application is a clone of the original Wordle game, written in React and Typescript
      The playing field is a set of 6 rows and 5 columns of empty fields corresponding to the letters of the puzzled word.
      After each attempt the system checks the guessed letters and their positions. 
      <br/>
      <br/>
      If the player guessed the right letter and it is in the right position, it is highlighted in green.
       If the player guessed the letter correctly but it is in the wrong position, it is highlighted in yellow. 
       If the letter is not guessed, the field becomes gray.
       <br/>
       <br/>
       The player has only 6 tries to guess the word. If the player could not guess the word after 6 tries,
      the game reports that the player has lost. If the player guessed the word, the game congratulates him
        on his victory.

    description: `Currency Converter, written in JavaScript, is a handy tool for fast and 
      accurate currency conversion. It has a simple interface, 
      consisting of two input fields and two drop-down lists where the user
      can select the currencies to be converted.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The user can enter an amount in the first field and select the initial 
      currency from the first list. Then, by selecting the desired currency from 
      the second list, he will receive the equivalent amount in the selected currency. 
      The converter updates the result instantly whenever the input data changes.
      <br/>
      <br/>
      The converter uses the API to obtain up-to-date exchange rate data. 
      The API provides access to reliable sources of currency data, such as NBU. 
      This allows the user to always have up-to-date information about currency 
      conversion and guarantees the accuracy of the results.
